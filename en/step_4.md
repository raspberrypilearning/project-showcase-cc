## Link to A Trinket

You can link to the web page for a trinket. 



+ Did you keep a link to your Happy Birthday trinket? If you did then open that trinket in another browser tab or window. Otherwise open the finished example trinket: <a href="https://trinket.io/html/e996dc0380">https://trinket.io/html/e996dc0380</a>

+ Click on the Share menu above your trinket and choose Link:

If you opened the trinket from your account then look for the Share option above your trinket instead:
