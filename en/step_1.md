## Introduction:
In this project, children are introduced to hyperlinks and embedding trinkets and Scratch projects within a webpage. 


## Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinket:

+ ['Project Showcase' starting point  -- jumpto.cc/web-showcase](http://jumpto.cc/web-showcase)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-blank)](http://jumpto.cc/html-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-template)](http://jumpto.cc/html-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ ['Project Showcase Finished' -- trinket.io/html/5b815ab120](https://trinket.io/html/5b815ab120)

## Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/webdev-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ project-showcase/index.html
+ project-showcase/style.css
+ template/template.html
+ template/style.css

You can also find a completed version of this project's challenges in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ project-showcse-finished/index.html
+ project-showcse-finished/style.css

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

Note that if the children have completed their other projects offline then they won't be able to embed them but they will still be able to link to them. 

## Learning Objectives
+ This project introduces text links to other webpages and to named ids within a page. It also introduces embedding trinkets and Scratch projects into a webpage.  

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Design basic 2D and 3D assets](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/design/creator)
+ Understand the skills which are developed towards a career involving Computing

## Challenges
+ “Add another link” - Add links to more webpages;
+ “Create a List of Your Projects” - Create links to previous web projects;
+ “Embed More Projects” - Use CSS to create new styles.
